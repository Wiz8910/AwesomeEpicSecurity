1 First node must be installed on your system if you are on linux simply sudo apt-get install nodejs
otherwise here is the site with installers https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2 To install project dependencies navigate to nodeStuff directory and type "npm install"
3 To run the project in the same directory type nodejs index.js
4 Navigate to localhost:3003 in firefox(chrome doesn't grant the site permission to alter local file system)
5 Inputs are expected to be selected from  \nodeStuff\inputs so place files in that directory
