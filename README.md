# AwesomeEpicSecurity
ToRun
1 First node must be installed on your system if you are on linux simply sudo apt-get install nodejs
otherwise here is the site with installers https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2 To install project dependencies navigate to nodeStuff directory and type "npm install"
3 To run the project in the same directory type nodejs index.js
4 Navigate to localhost:3003 in firefox(chrome doesn't grant the site permission to alter local file system)
5 Inputs are expected to be selected from  \nodeStuff\inputs so place files in that directory
6 File writing is asynchronous, that means you don't have to wait for a file to be done processing before you
  start processing the next one, however you better wait before the resulting file is expected size before messing with
  an encrypted or decrypted file
7 Enjoy AwesomeEpicSecurity!
